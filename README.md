# odin-landingpage
Part of the Odin Project. Creating a web page from scratch using a provided design.

I have been given 2 images, one is what the finished web page should look like, the other is a sheet of the various fonts and colours I should use. With these images I am required to use my newly-learned HTML and CSS knowledge to create the web page on VSCode from scratch.

During this project I will use many abilities I've learned with both HTML and CSS, these consist of abilities such as:
Using flexbox to appropriately arrange elements on the page correctly across both axes, 
The ability to change an elements padding and margin to finely tune the positioning of elements on the page,
Inegrating HTML and CSS seamlessly with a clear understanding of the external CSS method, 
Using Chrome DevTools to test and de-bug my web-page,
A clear understanding on how to create a web page with just a design concept to go off of.
